# BaslerPicoCalibration
BaslerPicoCalibration is a Python project aimed at expanding the capabilities of the Basler color calibrator by enabling support for smaller field of view applications. Traditionally, the Basler color calibrator is limited to 24-color charts with a minimum size of 50mm x 70mm, which may not meet the requirements of industries with smaller field of view needs, such as 10mm x 10mm.

This project addresses this limitation by introducing support for the Pico Color Gauge Target, measuring just 1.58mm x 1.58mm. The software captures images of the Pico Color Gauge Target using a Basler camera, extracts individual color patches, and rearranges them into the standard 24-color chart format. This allows seamless integration with the Basler color calibrator tools, enabling accurate color calibration for applications with smaller field of view requirements.

Key Features:

Capture images of the Pico Color Gauge Target using Basler cameras.
Extract individual color patches from captured images.
Rearrange color patches into the standard 24-color chart format.
Compatible with Basler color calibrator tools for accurate color calibration.
Explore BaslerPicoCalibration to enhance color calibration capabilities for your smaller field of view applications.
